Goal: Analyze this Ruby class and have a class discussions on failures of the code. Then improve the class to follow principles of Martin's Clean Code.
Class Discussion:
- unused bits of code.
- code didnt explain itself.
- big string splitting method is out of place.
- what is actually starting the discussion?
- More white space
- Inconsistent syntax (camel vs All caps) 
- Users maybe should be its own class.
